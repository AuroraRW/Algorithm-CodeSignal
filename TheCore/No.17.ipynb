The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.\n",

    "You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number n the kth bit from the right was initially set to 0, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the kth bit of n back to 0.\n",
