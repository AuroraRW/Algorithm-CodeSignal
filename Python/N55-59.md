### No.55 Twins Score
Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

Billy and Mandy are twins, and as such they do everything together. Unfortunately during the finals they were forced to write their exams separately, which explains why they got such low scores. However, they are not too sad about it: since they are twins, it's only natural for them to work together, so they are going to sum up their scores for each exam and show them to their mom.

Given two lists of equal size representing the scores Billy and Mandy got for each exam (b and m, respectively), return a single list containing their combined score.

Example

For b = [22, 13, 45, 32] and m = [28, 41, 13, 32],
the output should be
twinsScore(b, m) = [50, 54, 58, 64].

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] array.integer b

    The scores Billy got during the finals.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ b.length ≤ 20,
    0 ≤ b[i] ≤ 100.

    [input] array.integer m

    The scores Mandy got during the finals.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    m.length = b.length,
    0 ≤ m[i] ≤ 100.

    [output] array.integer
        The total scores the twins got during the finals.
```python
def twinsScore(b, m):
    return [x+y for x,y in zip(b, m)]
```
```python
def twinsScore(b, m):
    return list(map(sum, zip(b, m)))
```
```python
def twinsScore(b, m):
    return list(map(lambda a, b: a+b , b, m))
```
```python
def twinsScore(b, m):
    return [b[i]+m[i] for i in range(len(b))]
```
### No.56 Pressure Gauges
Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

Harry dropped out of school to pursue his dreams and work in Pipes Corporations. He is now in charge of a lot of pipes, and his task is to check the gauges twice a day. By analyzing the morning and evening pressures of each pipe, Harry should write a report about the minimum and the maximum pressure during the day.

Given the pressures Harry wrote down for each pipe, return two lists: the first one containing the minimum, and the second one containing the maximum pressure of each pipe during the day.

Example

For morning = [3, 5, 2, 6] and evening = [1, 6, 6, 6],
the output should be
pressureGauges(morning, evening) = [[1, 5, 2, 6], [3, 6, 6, 6]].

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] array.integer morning

    A list of pressures, where the ith element is the value the pressure gauge showed for the ith pipe in the morning.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ morning.length ≤ 10,
    0 ≤ morning[i] ≤ 1000.

    [input] array.integer evening

    A list of evening pressures in the same format as morning.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    evening.length = morning.length,
    0 ≤ evening[i] ≤ 1000.

    [output] array.array.integer
        A list containing two lists, where the ith elements of the first and the second lists are the minimum and the maximum pressures the ith pipe had, respectively.
```python
def pressureGauges(morning, evening):
    return [list(map(lambda a, b: min(a,b), morning, evening)),list(map(lambda a, b: max(a,b), morning, evening))]
```
### No.57 Correct Lineup
For the opening ceremony of the upcoming sports event an even number of athletes were picked. They formed a correct lineup, i.e. such a lineup in which no two boys or two girls stand together. The first person in the lineup was a girl. As a part of the performance, adjacent pairs of athletes (i.e. the first one together with the second one, the third one together with the fourth one, etc.) had to swap positions with each other.

Given a list of athletes, return the list of athletes after the changes, i.e. after each adjacent pair of athletes is swapped.

Example

For athletes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the output should be
correctLineup(athletes) = [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5].

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] array.integer athletes

    A list of even length representing the athletes, where each athlete is given by the number written on their back.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    2 ≤ athletes.length ≤ 20,
    1 ≤ athletes[i] ≤ 100.

    [output] array.integer
        Array of athletes with each pair of adjacent elements swapped.
```python
def correctLineup(athletes):
    return [x for t in zip(athletes[1::2],athletes[::2]) for x in t]
```
### No.58 Group Dating
Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

You're organizing a group dating activity for cats, i.e. a meeting where an equal number of male and female cats get together. For each cat you calculate their nature value, an integer that describes the cat's spirit. When a male and a female cat with the same nature value see each other, they become connected and happily walk out together.

You've just started another group dating, and placed the cats in front of one another so that the ith male is sitting across the ith female. What cats will remain at their places, assuming that the pairs of cats sitting in front of each other and having the same nature values will walk out?

Example

For male = [5, 28, 14, 99, 17] and
female = [5, 14, 28, 99, 16],
the output should be
groupDating(male, female) = [[28, 14, 17], [14, 28, 16]].

Pairs of cats at positions 0 and 3 (0-based) have the same nature values, so they will leave the meeting.

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] array.integer male

    Nature values of male cats.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ male.length ≤ 20,
    0 ≤ male[i] ≤ 100.

    [input] array.integer female

    Nature values of female cats.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    female.length = male.length,
    0 ≤ female[i] ≤ 100.

    [output] array.array.integer
        A list of two elements, where the first element will contain nature values of the remaining male cats, and the second element will contain nature values of the remaining female cats. In both cases, the values should go in the order the corresponding cats are sitting.

    Note: if your solution returns a list of tuples, the tuples will be converted to list automatically.
```python
def groupDating(male, female):
    return [[x for x,y in zip(male, female) if x!=y],[y for x,y in zip(male, female) if x!=y]]
```
### No.59 Fix Tree
Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

Not long ago a young Christmas elf asked you to implement a function that creates Christmas trees made of asterisks ('*') similar to the one below:

    *    
    *    
   ***   
  *****  
 ******* 
*********
   ***   

Unfortunately because of the extreme coldness the tree that you sent over was corrupted: although its lines are given in the correct order, but are not aligned properly. Now your task is to fix the given tree by centering the asterisks in each line.

Example

For

tree = [
  "      *  ", 
  "    *    ", 
  "***      ", 
  "    *****", 
  "  *******", 
  "*********", 
  " ***     "
]

the output should be

fixTree(tree) = [
  "    *    ", 
  "    *    ", 
  "   ***   ", 
  "  *****  ", 
  " ******* ", 
  "*********", 
  "   ***   "
]

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] array.string tree

    A list representing a tree, where all strings have the same odd length and have the format "< ><*>< >", where < > denotes some (possibly none) whitespace characters, and <*> denotes an odd number of asterisk.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ tree.length ≤ 31,
    1 ≤ tree[0].length ≤ 21.

    [output] array.string
        A fixed tree, with asterisks centered in each line.
```python
def fixTree(tree):
    return [x.strip().center(len(x),' ')for x in tree]
```
```python
def fixTree(tree):
    return list(map(lambda s: s.strip().center(len(s)), tree))
```
