### No.60 Pref Sum
Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

There is a great technique that allows finding sums of consecutive elements in the given array extremely fast. It is based on the usage of prefix sums. Given array a, your task is to calculate all its prefix sums.

Example

For a = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
prefSum(a) = [1, 3, 6].

Here's how the prefix sums can be calculated: [1, 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 3] = [1, 3, 6].

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] array.integer a

    Guaranteed constraints:
    2 ≤ a.length ≤ 3 · 104,
    -1000 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000.

    [output] array.integer
```python
from itertools import accumulate
def prefSum(a):
    return list(accumulate(a))
```
```python
def prefSum(a):
    return list(functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + [x[-1]+ y], a[1:], [a[0]]))
```
### No.61 Math Practice
Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

Little Billy is not too good with numbers and having trouble even multiplying and adding them. He needs some practice, and you are the one helpful fellow who can give him a list of numbers to practice on. Given a list of numbers, Billy should calculate the following value:

(((...(a[0] + a[1]) * a[2] + a[3]) * a[4] + ...)

Unfortunately you yourself are not too good with math, but you know how to code. Implement a function that, given a list of numbers, will return the result of the operation Billy has to perform.

Example

For numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the output should be
mathPractice(numbers) = 71.

Here's how the answer is obtained: ((1 + 2) * 3 + 4) * 5 + 6 = 71.

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] array.integer numbers

    A list of numbers.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    2 ≤ numbers.length ≤ 20,
    0 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 50.

    [output] integer
        The answer Billy should obtain.
```python
def mathPractice(numbers):
    return functools.reduce(lambda sum,x: sum+numbers[x+1] if x%2==0 else sum*numbers[x+1],range(len(numbers)-1),numbers[0])
```
```python
from functools import reduce
def mathPractice(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda acc,x: (acc+x[1] if x[0]%2 else acc*x[1]),
                  enumerate(numbers), 1)
```
### No.62 Check Participants
Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

You're organizing murder mystery games for your coworkers, and came up with a lot of ideas for various groups of participants. The ith 0-based game can be played only if there are at least i people registered for it. Game number 0 is a beta that you will try out with your friends, so there's no need for participants.

You're expecting a full house, since a lot of participants signed up already. Not too many, unfortunately: looks like some games can't be played, because too few people registered for them. Given the list of participants, your task is to return the list of games for which too few people signed up.

Example

For participants = [0, 1, 1, 5, 4, 8], the output should be
checkParticipants(participants) = [2].

For the game number 2 (0-based) 2 people are required, but only one person has registered.

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] array.integer participants

    The ith element of the array contains the number of coworkers signed up for the ith game.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ participants.length ≤ 100,
    0 ≤ participants[i] ≤ 150.

    [output] array.integer
        A sorted array of games for which too few people signed up.

```python
def checkParticipants(participants):
    return [i for i, e in enumerate(participants) if e < i]
```
```python
def checkParticipants(participants):
    return list(filter(lambda i: participants[i]<i, range(len(participants))))
```
### No.63 Fibonacci List
Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

No time to explain! The World Government made contact with intelligent alien life, and needs you to send a message to the outer space. The aliens only receive messages that are stored in a sequence of lists of sizes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., in other words those whose length increase according to the Fibonacci sequence.

The Government is too busy composing the message, and needs you to prepare the list in which the message should be sent. Given an integer n, return a list of n lists, where the first element consists is empty (consists of 0 zeros), the second element consists of 1 zero, and so on.

Example

For n = 6, the output should be

fibonacciList(n) = [[], 
                    [0], 
                    [0], 
                    [0, 0], 
                    [0, 0, 0], 
                    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] integer n

    The size of the list you should return.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    2 ≤ n ≤ 20.

    [output] array.array.integer
        A 2-dimensional list of zeros, where the list sizes form the Fibonacci sequence.
```python
def fibonacciList(n):
    return [[0] * x for x in functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + [x[-2] + x[-1]], range(n - 2), [0, 1])]
```
### No.64 Primes Sum
Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

It is believed by some tribes of South Codelenica that only two events determine the person's destiny: the first time he picked a flower, and the first time he planted one. They also believe in the power of prime numbers and in the power of sums (and a bunch of other most probably unrelated stuff), so you are wondering if it has something to do with their belief in the destiny-determining events.

You know that you first picked a flower in year a of the Codelenican calendar, and planted it in year b. Now you're curious about the sum of all the prime numbers in the range [a, b], to see if this number could possibly affect your life.

Example

For a = 10 and b = 20, the output should be
primesSum(a, b) = 60.

There are 4 prime numbers in the range [10, 20]: 11, 13, 17 and 19. Their sum is equal to 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 60. It's a round number, maybe it does mean something?..

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] integer a

    The year in which you picked a flower for the first time.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 105.

    [input] integer b

    The year in which you planted a flower for the first time.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 105.

    [output] integer
        The sum of prime numbers in the range [a, b].
```python
def primesSum(a, b):
    return sum([x for x in range(max(a,2),b+1) if not 0 in[x%z for z in range(2, int(x**0.5+1))]])
```
